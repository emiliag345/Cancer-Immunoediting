Modeling chemical kinetics of T-cell and cancer interaction in MATLAB

A system of ordinary differential equations was used to model the kinetics of T cell and cancer interaction during cancer immunoediting. The solutions of the system were approximated using Eulerâ€™s numerical integration method.

## Cancer kinetics
Let $$X_i$$ be the number of cancer cells of variant i. The dynamics of these cells could be modeled using the following differential equation with two functions $$f_1(X_i)$$ and $$f_2(X_i, Y_i)$$.
